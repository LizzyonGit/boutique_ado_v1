        At the top I'm going to import
        the bag contents function from bag.context. Which as you know makes that function
        available for use here in our views. Since really all that function returns
        is a Python dictionary. We can pass it the request
        and get the same dictionary here in the view. I'll store that in a variable called current bag.
        Making sure not to overwrite the bag variable that already exists
        And now to get the total all I need to do is get the grand_total key out of the current bag.
        I'll multiply that by a hundred and round it to zero decimal places using the round function.
        Since stripe will require the amount to charge as an integer.
